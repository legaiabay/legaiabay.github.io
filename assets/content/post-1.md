A step-by-step guide to building a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Docker.

First, we set up the repository and define the workflow file. This allows us to automate testing and deployment.

Next, we configure environment variables and secrets for secure deployments. This step is crucial for keeping sensitive data out of your codebase.

We also set up automated tests to run on every push, ensuring code quality and reliability.

Finally, we integrate Docker for containerization and push images to a registry. This enables consistent deployments across different environments.

With this setup, you can deliver features faster and with greater confidence.
