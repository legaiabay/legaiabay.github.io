In this post, I share my experience building my first API using Go (Golang).

Go’s simplicity and performance make it a great choice for backend development. I started by setting up a basic HTTP server using the standard `net/http` package.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, Go API!")
}

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

After running the server, I tested the endpoint using curl and Postman. The response was fast and reliable.

I also explored Go’s concurrency features and added a simple goroutine to handle background tasks.

Overall, building an API in Go was a fun and educational experience. I look forward to using Go in more projects!
