This post demonstrates how I built a simple AI chatbot demo.

I used a pre-trained language model and integrated it with a web interface for real-time conversations. The backend was powered by Python and Flask, while the frontend used JavaScript for asynchronous communication.

Key steps included:

- Setting up the Flask server to handle chat requests
- Connecting the frontend to the backend using AJAX
- Formatting responses to mimic natural conversation

The result was a chatbot that could answer questions, provide suggestions, and even tell jokes!

Building this demo helped me understand the basics of NLP and how to deploy AI models in real-world applications.
